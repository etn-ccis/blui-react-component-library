# Three Liner

The `ThreeLiner` can display up to three lines of stylized text or other custom content. It is most commonly used within the context of a [`AppBar`](./AppBar.md) component where the text can grow / shrink as the App Bar is expanded and collapsed.

### Classes

You can override the classes used by Brightlayer UI by passing a `classes` prop. It supports the following keys:

| Name     | Description                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| root     | Styles applied to the root element |
| title    | Styles applied to the first line   |
| subtitle | Styles applied to the second line  |
| info     | Styles applied to the third line   |

### `sx` Class Overrides

You can override the styles used by Brightlayer UI by passing a `sx` prop. The `sx` prop styles will override styles provided through the `Classes` prop.

```tsx
import { ThreeLiner } from '@brightlayer-ui/react-components';
import * as colors from '@brightlayer-ui/colors';
...
<ThreeLiner
    sx={{ color: colors.blue[200] }}
    title={'Three Liner Component'}
    subtitle={'with basic usage'}
    info={'...and a third line'}
/>
```
