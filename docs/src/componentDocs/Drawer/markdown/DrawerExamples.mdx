## Drawer

The `<Drawer>` is a navigational element that holds links to different pages in your application. It organizes content using sub-elements for:

-   [Drawer Header](/components/drawer-header/examples)
-   [Drawer Subheader](/components/drawer-subheader/examples)
-   [Drawer Body](/components/drawer-body/examples)
-   [Drawer Nav Group](/components/drawer-nav-group/examples)
-   [Drawer Nav Item](/components/drawer-nav-item/examples)
-   [Drawer Rail Item](/components/drawer-rail-item/examples)
-   [Drawer Footer](/components/drawer-footer/examples)

## Customizing the Drawer

The Drawer is highly customizable for organizing and styling your items. Navigation items can be declared in a list format to simplify your JSX and make customization easier.

## Permanent Variant

The `'permanent'` drawer is full-sized and always visible.

## Persistent Variant

The `'persistent'` drawer can be opened and closed. When opened, it pushes the main application content.

## Temporary Variant

The `'temporary'` drawer is hidden until it is opened. When open, it appears as an overlay on top of the application content. This is typically used on smaller screens and mobile devices.

## Navigation Rail

The `'rail'` variant is always opened but takes up less space than a full-sized drawer.
