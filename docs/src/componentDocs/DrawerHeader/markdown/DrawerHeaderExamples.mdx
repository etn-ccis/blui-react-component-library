import { DrawerHeader, DrawerHeaderWithTitleContent } from '../examples';

## Drawer Header

The `<DrawerHeader>` appears at the top of a drawer. It is commonly used to show your application title and holds controls for the drawer.

<DrawerHeader />

## Customizing the Title Content

If you want to display more than just a title and subtitle, you can pass custom content via `titleContent` prop.

<DrawerHeaderWithTitleContent />
