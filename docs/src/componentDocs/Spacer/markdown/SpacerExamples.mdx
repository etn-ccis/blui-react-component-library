## Spacer with Flex

A `<Spacer>` is a utility component that adds space between elements (such as [Drawer Nav Groups](/components/drawer/drawer-nav-group/examples)). The Spacer is typically used in a flex layout.

## Spacer with Pixels

A Spacer can also be given fixed dimensions instead of flex for static layouts. In order to use fixed dimensions the `flex` prop must be set to zero.
