# React Themes Overview

This package, `@brightlayer-ui/react-themes`, provides [Material UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/material) themes for Eaton applications using the Brightlayer UI design system with React. We offer two theme options: a Blue theme (standard) and a Dark theme.

# What Do The Themes Look Like?

Have a look at the component theme explorer below to learn how Brightlayer UI themes work at a high level. Here we showcase the components that most fully represent Material Design and Brightlayer UI, and how our themes affect them.

<ThemeExplorer />

You are also encouraged to explore our more detailed [example / showcase project](https://blui-react-showcase.web.app/) which gives a clearer picture of the Material Design and Brightlayer UI components and theme interactions.

# Installation

## For New Projects

We encourage you to use [Brightlayer UI CLI](https://brightlayer-ui.github.io/development/cli) to generate a new project. The CLI is a tool that can generate a bare bones React project that includes all essential Brightlayer UI packages, including the Brightlayer UI themes.

## For Existing Projects

To integrate the package into an existing project, you may install it with npm:

<CodeBlock code={`npm install --save @brightlayer-ui/react-themes`} language={'sh'} />

or yarn:

<CodeBlock code={`yarn add @brightlayer-ui/react-themes`} language={'sh'} />
