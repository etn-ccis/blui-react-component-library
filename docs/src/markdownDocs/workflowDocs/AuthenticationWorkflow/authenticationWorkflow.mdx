# Login / Authentication Workflow Guide

The authentication workflow includes screens related to user authentication including Login, Forgot Password, Reset Password, etc.

This guide covers two approaches for implementing login/authentication workflows: Okta and Custom Login.


## Okta Approach
The Okta approach leverages Okta's identity and access management services to handle user authentication, including login and password management. By integrating with Okta, you can offload the complexities of authentication and focus on building your application.

### OktaAuthContextProvider

The login screen in this workflow accesses shared data / configuration / API definitions through an `OktaAuthContextProvider` which should wrap the screen. We recommend using Okta to manage the additional password-related screens (Forgot / Reset / Change), but if you prefer to use those screens from this workflow, you'll need to wrap those screens with the `AuthContextProvider` (see custom workflow below).

You must supply the `OktaAuthContextProvider` with the following props / data:
-   `language`: configures the language displayed on the screens
-   `navigate`: a function that can be called to navigate to a new route
-   `routeConfig`: an object describing the URLs you are using for the relevant routes so the workflow can correctly navigate between screens

More information about the required and optional props can found in the [API](#okta-auth-context-provider-api) section.

### Example

Here is an example of how you would set up the Okta Redirect Login workflow using our recommended routing solution ([React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)).

Each feature/screen from the Okta Auth Workflow that you wish to use should be rendered on a separate route.

<CodeBlock
    language={'jsx'}
    code={`<Routes>
    <Route
        element={
            <OktaAuthContextProvider
                language={'en'}
                navigate={navigate}
                routeConfig={{}}
            >
                <OktaRedirectLogin />
            </OktaAuthContextProvider>
        }
    />
</Routes>`}
/>

For a detailed explanation of setting up routes, see the [Routing](/workflows/routing/) guide.

### Okta Auth Context Provider API

### OktaAuthContextProviderProps

| Prop Name | Type | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| language* | `string` | The language code specifying which language to use for the UI | `'en'` |
| navigate* | `(url: string) => void` | A function that is used to navigate to a new URL. This is used to navigate to the various screens of the authentication workflow. |  |
| routeConfig* | `RouteConfig` | An object that defines the various routes for the authentication workflow. See [RouteConfig](#routeconfig) for more information. |  |
| i18n | `i18n` | An optional i18n object that is used to translate the UI. This is only needed if you want to use custom translation keys / languages inside any of the workflow screens |  |
| errorConfig | `ErrorContextProviderProps` | An object that is used to configure error handling within the workflow. See [Error Management](/workflows/error-management/) for more information. |  |


## Custom Login Approach

The Custom Login approach allows you to implement your own authentication logic. This workflow includes screens related to user authentication such as Login, Forgot Password, Reset Password, etc. By implementing your own authentication logic, you have full control over the authentication process and can customize it to meet your application's needs.

### AuthContextProvider

The screens in this workflow access shared data / configuration / API definitions through an `AuthContextProvider` which should wrap all of the relevant routes / screens.

You must supply the `AuthContextProvider` with the following props / data:
-   `actions`: defines the API calls / functions to execute when certain actions are performed in the UI (such as pressing the Login button)
-   `language`: configures the language displayed on the screens
-   `navigate`: a function that can be called to navigate to a new route
-   `routeConfig`: an object describing the URLs you are using for the relevant routes so the workflow can correctly navigate between screens

More information about the required and optional props can found in the [API](#api) section.

### Implement AuthUIActions

Because this workflow package is back-end agnostic, you must provide an implementation for what happens when the user triggers certain behaviors in the UI.

The example project includes a skeleton implementation of all required functions using mocks / sleeps. You will need to replace these implementations with appropriate calls to your APIs, caching the returned data, etc. depending on the requirements of your application.

1. Create a `AuthUIActions.ts` file
    - This file will handle the implementation of the authentication related actions (such as login and forgot password).
    - You can copy this file directly from the [example](../example/src/actions/AuthUIActions.tsx) project as a starting point and then update the implementation details if you choose.
2. You might also want to copy over the `example/src/store` and `example/src/constants` folders, which provide a very basic mechanism for storing important data using LocalStorage
    -   You will want to switch this out for a more secure approach before going to production with your application.

### Example

Here is an example of how you would set up the Login workflow using our recommended routing solution ([React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)).

Each feature/screen from the Auth Workflow that you wish to use should be rendered on a separate route.

<CodeBlock
    language={'jsx'}
    code={`<Routes>
    {/* Wrap all routes in a single shared AuthContextProvider */}
    <Route
        element={
            <AuthContextProvider
                actions={actions}
                language={'en'}
                navigate={navigate}
                routeConfig={{}}
                rememberMeDetails={{}}
            >
                <Outlet />
            </AuthContextProvider>
        }
    >
        {/* Routes for each workflow screen you want to include */}
        <Route/>
        <Route/>
        <Route/>
        <Route/>
    </Route>
    ...
</Routes>`}
/>
