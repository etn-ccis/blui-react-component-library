# Language Support

This package supports translations to different languages using [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) / [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next). Out of the box, the workflow screens are available in:

-   English
-   French
-   Portuguese
-   Spanish
-   Simplified Chinese

If you wish to support additional languages, refer to the [Add Custom Language](#add-custom-language) section below.

The translation dictionary used by the workflows is independent of any translations / dictionaries used in your main application. This eliminates the possibility of your translations unintentionally overriding values that are used by the workflows screens. When setting up internationalization for your application, you can follow the instructions for [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) without worrying about the workflow screens.

## Changing the Language

The language used by the workflow screens is exclusively driven by the `language` prop passed to the `RegistrationContextProvider`.

You can change the language used in your application in a number of different ways using react-i18next — just make sure to update the value passed into the workflows so they remain in sync.

## Using Your Translations in Workflow Screens

By default, the translations inside the workflow screens are isolated from the translations used for your application. If you want to override a string used for a text element on one of the screens, this can be configured by passing the appropriate prop.

However, because the translation providers are separate for the workflow and for the app, if you want to use one of your translation keys inside a workflow screen, you will need to pass your i18n instance to the `i18n` prop of the `RegistrationContextProvider` so we can access your dictionary. If you do not do this, the workflow will attempt to find your application key in the workflow dictionary and it will not be found.


## Add Custom Language

If you would like to support a language other than the ones supported by the workflow, you can, but you will need to provide the translations for all of the strings that are needed by the workflow screens. If you do not, the workflow screens will default to showing English.

The example below shows how to do this for a few keys, but you will need to provide all of the keys in your actual implementation (refer to the links at the bottom of the page for a list of all of the keys that must be provided).

<CodeBlock
    language={'jsx'}
    code={`// Common Keys shared by Auth and Registration workflows
const commonWorkflowKorean =  {
    translation: {
        ACTIONS: {
            NEXT: '다음',
        },
    },
}
// Registration Workflow Keys
const registrationWorkflowKorean = {
    translation: {
        REGISTRATION: {
            EULA: {
                LOADING: '최종 사용자 라이선스 계약 로드 중...',
            },
        },
    },
};

// Create your application i18n instance
export const i18nAppInstance = i18next.createInstance(
    {
        ...
        resources: {
            ...
            kr: {
                // provide your app-side translation in your app namespace
                app: {
                    ...AppDictionaries.korean.translation,
                },
                // provide the custom workflow translations to the workflow namespaces
                bluiAuth: {
                    ...authWorkflowKorean.translation,
                },
                bluiRegistration: {
                    ...registrationWorkflowKorean.translation,
                },
                bluiCommon: {
                    ...commonWorkflowKorean.translation,
                },
            },
        },
    },
);`}
/>

You will then need to pass this i18n instance through the `i18n` prop on the `RegistrationContextProvider` wrappers.
