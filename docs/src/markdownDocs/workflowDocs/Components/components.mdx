# Components

There are a number of additional components that are exported by this workflow package, including Core components and Utility components.

## Core Components

Core components provide core functionality related to the workflows in this package. It's expected that you will use them in most cases.

- [RegistrationWorkflow](/workflows/registration-workflow/)

## Utility Components

These utility components are used as sub-components to build some of our other screens and components. If you have a need for them elsewhere in your application, we export them for your convenience. These are most useful if you are creating custom screens to inject into the Registration Workflow.


- [BasicDialog](/workflows/basic-dialog/)
- [ErrorManager](/workflows/error-manager/)
- [PasswordTextField](/workflows/password-text-field/)
- [SetPassword](/workflows/set-password/)
- [WorkflowCard*](/workflows/workflow-card/)
