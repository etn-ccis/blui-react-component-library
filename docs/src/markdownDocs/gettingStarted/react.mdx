# Getting Started with Brightlayer UI

The following instructions will guide you through starting a new Brightlayer UI project using React. Alternatively, you can also start your project by downloading one of our code samples from [Github](https://github.com/etn-ccis?q=blui) (the Login or Navigation examples are good projects to start from).

# Generating a New Project with the Brightlayer UI CLI

The fastest way to start a new Brightlayer UI project is to use the [Brightlayer UI CLI](https://brightlayer-ui.github.io/development/cli). The CLI will automatically create a starter project for you (using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)) with all of the necessary Brightlayer UI dependencies pre-configured. To start a React project:

<CodeBlock code={`npx -p @brightlayer-ui/cli blui new react`} language={'sh'} />

You will be asked to provide a name for your project and whether you want to use the Brightlayer UI eslint and prettier configuration files.

The Brightlayer UI CLI will automatically include:

-   MUI Component Library and Icons ([@mui/material](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/material) / [@mui/icons-material](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/icons-material))
-   Brightlayer UI Component Library ([@brightlayer-ui/react-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-components))
-   Brightlayer UI Themes ([@brightlayer-ui/react-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-themes))
-   Brightlayer UI Icons ([@brightlayer-ui/icons-mui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/icons-mui))
-   Brightlayer UI Colors ([@brightlayer-ui/colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/colors))
-   Open Sans web font ([@fontsource/open-sans](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fontsource/open-sans))
-   Brightlayer UI ESLint and Prettier configurations, if selected ([@brightlayer-ui/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/eslint-config) / [@brightlayer-ui/prettier-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/prettier-config))

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the [Brightlayer UI CLI documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/cli).

# Integrating Brightlayer UI into an Existing Project

Before taking the following steps, you'll want to make sure that you have an existing application. If you used the Brightlayer UI CLI to start your project, these steps have already been done for you automatically.

## Including the Component Libraries

### MUI

React projects should make use of the [MUI](https://mui.com/) component library, formerly known as Material UI. Our Brightlayer UI themes are designed to work with these components. You'll also want to install the icons.

<CodeBlock
    code={`npm install --save @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`}
    language={'sh'}
/>

or

<CodeBlock code={`yarn add @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`} language={'sh'} />

For detailed documentation about the various components available in MUI, as well as sample code and API reference, refer to the [MUI Documentation](https://mui.com/).

### Brightlayer UI Components

Additionally, we have a [supplemental library](/components/component-catalog) of components designed specifically for Brightlayer UI applications. If you wish to use these components, you can install them by running:

<CodeBlock code={`npm install --save @brightlayer-ui/react-components`} language={'sh'} />

or

<CodeBlock code={`yarn add @brightlayer-ui/react-components`} language={'sh'} />

## Adding Brightlayer UI Themes

By default, your application will be themed with the Google Material theme. To use the [Brightlayer UI theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-themes), follow the intructions [here](/themes/overview).

# Additional Information

## Code Formatting / Style

Brightlayer UI provides packages for code standards and style using ESLint and Prettier. These packages are used internally by the Brightlayer UI team, but they can also be used in your projects. You can find instructions for adding these packages to your project on [GitHub](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-code-standards).

> NOTE: the ESLint package is only available for TypeScript projects.

## Browser Support

Brightlayer UI supports the same browsers as React and MUI. For specifics, please check out their support pages:

-   [React](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/supported-browsers-features)
-   [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/supported-platforms/)

> With the end-of-life of Internet Explorer 11, Brightlayer UI will no longer be supporting IE11 as of 2021.

## License Information

[React](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/LICENSE) and [MUI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/LICENSE) are both available under the MIT License.
